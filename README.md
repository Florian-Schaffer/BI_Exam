Spending sensibly with BI

Annotation
	
	In order to help every-day citizens save money, this project will focus on analysis of spending habits.
	Relating total amount of sales to annual income, place of living and loyalty towards the product will hopefully give insights on whether these factors can impact you.
	People drawing knowledge from the analysis of this data will hopefully be able to better asses when/if they should spend their money and how satisfied they can expect to be.  


Context - Citizens' spending habits
Purpose - Reducing inflated costs
Questions - What has the biggest impact on total money spent
